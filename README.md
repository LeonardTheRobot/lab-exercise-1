# Exercise 1: Exploration and Mapping

## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to develop your ability to program the P3DX robot using ROS (and any other programming language of your choice). You will also learn to using existing ROS modules and develop components to be used in subsequent exercises.

## Task
Design and program your robot to explore the lower ground floor of the School of Computer Science. The robot should explore as much of the floor area as possible without getting stuck, and build a map of this area. You may use any techniques of your choice. The desired outcome of this task is a map of the area explored. Please remember that you will use your map of this area for the next exercise (on localization). You will also submit a two-page report on Canvas (11-point font, single-space) describing the techniques used to complete this task, along with a description of lessons learned or challenges faced while completing this task. Demos will be due in your assigned lab session on October 24 or 25.
